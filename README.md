# ðŸŽµConcert App

A modern full-stack web application for discovering, managing, and booking concerts â€” built with Next.js (frontend) and NestJS (backend).

## Running the Development Servers

### Frontend (Next.js):

From the /concert-app-frontend directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Backend (NestJS):

From the /concert-app-backend directory, run:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:5000

To run unit test

```bash
npm run test
```

Once both servers are running:

- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the frontend.
- The frontend will interact with the backend API at http://localhost:5000
- The backend swagger ui also available at http://localhost:5000/api
